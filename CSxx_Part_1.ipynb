        "\n",
        "The process of tackling the problem began with a thorough exploration of the features in the dataset folllowed by data preprocessing. The dataset is relatively small with 33,000 entries and 19 columns containing both numerical and textual data. All columns except the 'nature' column did not contain empty values which can be problematic for the models to deal with. Due to the limited data provided, a decision was made to fill the missing entries with the neutral value 'Other' rather than dropping them. Furthermore, the values in the 'psrel' columns, which contains the labels for the training of the binary classifiers, were found to be highly imbalanced with only 5.95% of the values belonging to the positive class. This is likely to result in the poor performance of the models in their predictions for the minority class and thus prevent us from achieving reasonable results. The severe imbalance in the class distributions of the dataset implies that some sort of a data augmentation technique has to be employed. One common approach to addressing such issues is to use an algorithm to oversample the minority class. Rather than just duplicating entries of the minority group, a better approach is to synthesize new data from the existing examples. This type of data augmentation is generally referred to as 'Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique', or SMOTE for short, and it was utilized in this task. After employing the SMOTE implementation from the imblearn library on the training dataset, the number of entries was increased in favour of the positive class resulting in a 50:50 distribution. **[1]**\n",
        "In addition,  a decision was made to drop some of the columns which did not contain relevant information that can be used to classify the documents - 'user', 'session', 'query', 'timestamp','cpvs'. The main reasoning behind this decision is that those columns contained different identifiers with regards to the query, but since their values are almost always unique they do not really contain that much useful information for the training process. Nevertheless, a more sophisticated solution could have been employed which ideally could have established a relationship between the session and user identifiers since some of the entries overlap in their values for these columns. What's more, the remaning columns which contained categorical data were one-hot encoded before they were fed into the models. The final stage of the preprocessing was to scale the data using sklearn's StandardScaler in order to improve the learning process further, especially for the standard machine learning model."

        "In terms of model, a standard machine learning solution had to be created to serve as a baseline for the other models. A decision was made to utilize an ensemble machine learning model, which usually provide better performance and generalization to more simplistic models. The classifier selected for the task was the GradientBoostingClassifier (GBC). This classifier combines multiple weak learning models (decision trees) in order to create a strong predictive model capable of handling complex datasets. In recent years GBC models are becoming more popular due to their effectiveness and such models have been winning scientific Kaggle competitions quite frequently. **[2]**"

        "##Neural Network Models\n",
        "As for the neural models developed, two such models were creating which differ in their architecture and complexity in order to test the effectiveness of each approach. Firstly, a baseline neural network model with three hidden layers was developed. Since this model was to be used as a base for comparison, neither regularization techniques such as regularizers and dropouts, nor more complex initialization schemes for the weighs were used in its specification. The architecture of the model is sequential/feedforward and it  consists of an input layer, which expects an input shape with 44 features (the total number of features after the one hot encoding of the data). Then, this layer is followed by three hidden Dense layers with a \"relu\" activation function and equal number of neurons. Finally, the output layer of this model has only one neuron and a sigmoid activation function, which makes it suitable for the binary classification task. The sigmoid function returns a value between 0 and 1 which makes it straight-forward to interpret the output as either belonging to the positive or negative class - values below 0.5 belong to the negative class, while values above 0.5 can be interpreted as part of the positive one.\n",

        "In order to test the performance on the dataset of a neural network with a different and more compltex architecture, an Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) model was designed. Generally , such models are usually employed to tackle problems involing sequential or time-series data due to their ability to capture information about what has been calculated so far in more complex memory cells in comparison to the normal neurons. Usually, RNNS are used for compltex tasks with sequential data  such as language translation, speech recognition, natural language processing.**[3]** Nevertheless, they have proven to be effective in finding solutions for binary classification issues as well, which is the reason why a model with such architecture was developed and evaluated. The model that was created consists of a series of N RNN layers with LSTM memory cells, each followed by a dropout layer that would help the model to generalise better and not overfit the data. Since the RNN expects a 3 dimensional array of training data, another version of the data reshaped in the format (Number of samples, Sequence length, Input dimensions). Similarly to the basic neural network model, the final output layer has one neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classificaiton. The class definitions for both neural network models are presented in the code snippet below.\n"

        "In order to achieve the best results possible, the configurations possible for the neural network, the optimal hidden layers and number of neurons had to be explored. For each of two models, a builder function was created and it was provided as a parameter to the KerasClassifier wrapper class. This wrapper was then used in the initialization of a RandomizedSearchCV along with a dictionary of the parameters that are to be explored. The RandomizedSearchCv class then runs a grid search based on the paramters value pairs provided and saves the result at each iteration. Finally, the best performing parameters can be obtained once the search is finished. Due to the limited GPU power and time provided in Google Collab, the space of values that was explored was fairly limited. The builder code for the builder functions for each of the deep learning models is shown below."
